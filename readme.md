### Ward-Level Digital Twin for Urban Policy Simulation

SmartWard AI is a **ward-level digital twin platform** designed to help urban planners and policymakers **simulate, analyze, and evaluate policy decisions before real-world execution**.

The system models a city ward as an interconnected digital environment and enables _what-if_ analysis across urban infrastructure. This repository currently contains a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** focused on **road-closure-based traffic impact simulation**, which serves as the **foundational building block** for the full system.

---

## 🔍 What This PoC Demonstrates

The current Proof of Concept establishes the **core digital twin mechanism**:

- Conversion of a real-world ward road network into a digital graph
- Simulation of a **policy intervention (road closure)**
- Recalculation of system behavior after intervention
- Quantitative impact analysis (route change & congestion proxy)
- Visualization of before vs after effects

This validates the **end-to-end workflow** of:

> **Digital Modeling → Policy Intervention → AI Simulation → Impact Evaluation**

## ✅ Implemented Features (PoC)

### 🚦 Mobility & Traffic Simulation

- Ward-level road network extraction using OpenStreetMap
- Graph-based representation of roads and intersections
- Shortest-path routing simulation
- Road closure as a policy intervention
